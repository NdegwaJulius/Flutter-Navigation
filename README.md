# navigation_flutter

In Flutter, screens and pages are called routes. The remainder of this recipe refers to routes.

## Getting Started

In Android, a route is equivalent to an Activity. In iOS, a route is equivalent to a ViewController. In Flutter, a route is just a widget.

This recipe uses the Navigator to navigate to a new route.

The next few sections show how to navigate between two routes, using these steps:

Create two routes.
Navigate to the second route using Navigator.push().
Return to the first route using Navigator.pop().
